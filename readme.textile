h1. ruby in java, java in ruby, jruby or ruby java bridge

Q: what are you supposed to use in your ruby|jruby|java application?

A: it depends!

h2. requirements

This project requires MRI and "JRuby":http://jruby.org, so you should be "using rvm":http://blog.nofail.de/2010/01/xruby-on-the-mac/.

"buildr":http://buildr.apache.org/ is used as a build tool:

<pre>
rvm use jruby
gem install buildr
</pre>

"rjb":http://rjb.rubyforge.org/ is required as a gem for MRI (no JRuby support):

<pre>
rvm use 1.8.7
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home
gem install rjb
</pre>

Tested on OS X Snow Leopard only!

h2. calling examples

You will have to execute the examples differently:

<pre>
rvm use jruby
ruby lib/jruby.rb

rvm use 1.8.7
ruby lib/rjb.rb
</pre>

h2. buildr

The Java stuff can be executed with buildr:

<pre>
rvm use jruby
buildr clean test
</pre>

Buildr provides an eclipse integration:

<pre>
rvm use jruby
buildr eclipse
artifacts:sources
</pre>
